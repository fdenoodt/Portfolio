## [2020] Image recognition alarm
Because waking up can be hard, I made a smart alarm to help me out. The alarm has a camera that is pointed at my bed and detects when I am sleeping. When it is time to wake up, the alarm will play an alarm as long as I stay in bed. Only when I walk out of bed, the alarm will stop. The alarm consists of a Raspberry pi, a camera and speakers. The frontend is developed in **Angular**, the backend is done in **Python** and uses **TensorFlow**/**Keras** for the image recognition part.

## [2020] 4 month internship as data scientist in the Netherlands
I worked as an intern for the Data Analytics team of Achmea. Data scientists have previously developed an image recognition model. My job was to extend their current solution so that other employees can develop their own machine learning models. (Similar to AutoML). The developed product includes a web application, which users can easily enter data and then train a model. In addition, several evaluation techniques have been implemented to assess the models. When a model does not perform satisfactorily, the application generates advice in one key sentence so that the end user can improve the model.

Grade: 16/20

Technologies:

- Data Science: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, YOLOv3
- Software development: Angular, .NET CORE, Azure Services

## [2019] Hackathon - WhatTheHack
2 day Hackathon, our objective was for awkward students to be able to make friends more easily.  
This we attempted to achieve by building a website, similar to Omegle but where the person gets matched with other students from the same school.  
If the conversation goes well they can add eachother as connection or if things go really well... even friends.
