## [2019] Hackathon - WhatTheHack
2 day Hackathon, our objective was for awkward students to be able to make friends more easily.  
This we attempted to achieve by building a website, similar to Omegle but where the person gets matched with other students from the same school.  
If the conversation goes well they can add eachother as connection or if things go really well... even friends.
